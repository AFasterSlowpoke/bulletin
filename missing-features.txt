Most notable missing features:

MUST BE MADE INTO GITHUB REPO ASAP
Sorry I can't access github at the moment ;(

No way to change the properties of pins depending on the content.
The intended solution to this was the PinCondition object, which could be passed
as an argument in place of any pin property such as font, position, color, etc.
PinConditions would be given a column or group of columns to check, a series of
conditions, and return values for those conditions.
For example, "Check 'rank' column. If it's 1, return yellow, if not return black."

One image per row, one row per image
If you want to include multiple rows of data in a single image, you're out of luck.
One proposed feature is the PostPin, which allows you to add a post of one board
as a pin to another board.
For example, you could create a board for making response strips, and then add posts
from that board using PostPins to another board, which consolidates them.
Boards would also need ways to batch data to do this.

Only one table per board

Google sheets Only

Absolute positions only, no containers
Lists, Grids and other containers are not implemented as of yet.

Only two kinds of basic pins: Text and image
ShapePins, EffectPins, etc would be great.

No support for randomness

No text align

Bug where transparent images display checkerboards behind them

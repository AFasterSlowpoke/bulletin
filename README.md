The exact same thing as https://github.com/smoov22/bulletin , but it simply does nothing if an image is not found instead of raising an error! (remove everything from the booksonas folder to see it work!)

Offline compatability may be coming soon (where you can get data from a local Excel or CSV file and not be forced to get something from a Google Sheets file)

i literally only changed one line xD
